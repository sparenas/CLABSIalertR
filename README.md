Getting Started

The official development version of CLABSIalertR is hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/sparenas/CLABSIalertR

To install the package from GitHub, run in an R session:

# install.packages("devtools")   # if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("sparenas/CLABSIalertR")
library(CLABSIalertR)


If you have downloaded the source package (CLABSIalertR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz), you may install it locally with:

install.packages("CLABSIalertR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz",
                 repos = NULL, type = "source")
library(CLABSIalertR)

For further details about how to use the package, read the vignette that comes with it.

If you cannot build the package manually, the GitHub method above is recommended.

Feel free to report issues, request features, or contribute improvements through the GitHub repository.
